Soeng Sing drifts above all things — a celestial serpent who guides souls along the Sky Serpent into Gholm’s care. His shrines are found at harbors, peaks, and waypoints. Sailors claim his tail whips storms away, while monks believe his whispers ease grief.

Serene and vast, Soeng Sing coils endlessly across the skies — an ancient, feathered serpent whose eyes see far beyond death. His scales shift with the seasons; his breath smells of salt and drifting incense. Back is long so that those who will take the long trip to the after life can ride, and feathers spurt out his spine to provide riders comfort. Otherwise, he is seen as a sullen old man in a blue robe.

In silence, he **guides souls into the next life.** Sailors whisper to her winds, monks tattoo his symbol along their spines, and grieving families burn offerings hoping he’ll coil gently around their lost.

When he is seen in dreams, it is said peace follows — whether in death or decision. His temples are open-roofed sanctuaries built at high altitudes. Pilgrims release ashes, lanterns, or letters into the wind to honor him.
