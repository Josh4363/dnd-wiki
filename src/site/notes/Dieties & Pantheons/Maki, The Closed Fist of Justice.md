**_Justice is not gentle. It strikes swiftly, without hesitation."

- **Domains**: Justice, Order, Light 
- **Symbol**: A gauntlet with a closed fist, with a Sun in the background
- **Patrons**: Judges and Magistrates, Knights, Guards
- **Alias**: Mother Justice, Queen Justiciar, *Tompeki*

Maki is the unyielding hand of law. Her temples are austere fortresses where order is upheld without emotion. She is revered by those who enforce peace and feared by those who break it. Stories say her fist once shattered a tyrant's throne with a single blow.

Clad in radiant plate that glows with the still light of high noon, Maki stands tall with unbending spine, face ever-veiled behind a mirrored visor. Her eyes burn with white light, and her gauntleted right hand is always clenched.Her presence carries the weight of law, the chill of consequence, and the quiet heartbeat of discipline. Wherever she walks, shadows retreat.

To some, she is the stern mother of civilization — the Queen Justiciar — whose judgment brings peace. To others, she is a steel tyrant, unmoved by nuance. Her philosophy is clear: **Order is peace. Mercy is dangerous when misplaced.**

**Temples** to Maki are austere marble halls. Her knights bear her sigil — a closed gauntlet before a golden sun — upon their cloaks. Her name is invoked at coronations, trials, and executions alike.
