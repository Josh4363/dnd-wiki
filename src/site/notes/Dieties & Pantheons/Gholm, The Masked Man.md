**_"He sees. He does not speak. That is mercy."_  

- **Domains**: Death, Silence, The Unknown, Knowledge Through Silent Observation

- **Alias**: The masked man, The Watcher, Death's Domain

Gholm presides over the stillness after death and the truths too terrible to say. His temples are mausoleums and archives. His priests take oaths of silence, and his mask is feared in both spycraft and mourning. He does not guide souls — he watches them go.

He stands at the edge of the world in eternal silence, face obscured by a skull-mask, one hand forever over his mouth. His presence is still. Watching. Waiting.

Gholm is **death’s curator**, not its cause. He catalogs endings. He guides no soul, but records every step. Scholars invoke him before forbidden study; assassins whisper his name after a clean kill.

To speak falsely in a temple of Gholm is to tempt erasure — not death, but _forgetting._ Those who wear his mask do not speak again. His priests take vows of silence. His temples are underground archives and crypts. Whispering in his halls is taboo.
