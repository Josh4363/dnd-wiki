Rend walks among the infected. He is not evil — but inevitable. Known for his quiet patience and awful mercy, Rend is invoked by both those administering medicine and those preparing final rites. Some view him as a cruel cleanser of unworthy life.

Cloaked in rags and crowned in rot, Rend walks where life thins. His flesh is often depicted as torn and healing simultaneously, as if **disease and cure wrestle within him**. But more often he is seen wearing a mask. He offers to open hands, one that radiates healing light, and another cursed with the ichor of pestilence.

He is not evil — but he is terrifying. He knows the frailty of flesh, the cost of miracles, and the relief of final breath. Physicians wear his sigil on hidden chains.

In the time of plague, he is both god and reaper. But even in sickness, he brings strange mercy — for to suffer is to feel deeply, and to be healed is to change forever.
