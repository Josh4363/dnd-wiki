**_“The road is long. All may walk it.”

- Domains: Redemption, The Lost, The Earth

- Alias: Mother Earth, The Road, She who shows the way, *Telela Luga (Fair god)

Ukuh waits for no one — but she never turns anyone away. She is a deity of second chances, especially for the exiled or broken. Her earth cradles both the lost and the redeemed. Forging a blade in her name is to promise it won’t strike unjustly again.

Ukuh is a quiet god — heavy as stone, warm as fertile earth. She appears as a towering woman with hair tied into a braids and, her eyes gleaming like deep emeralds. Her hair flows like clay, and gemstones sparkle beneath her skin. She walks barefoot, carving paths where she treads. Imposing and powerful even amongst the others of the pantheon. Those who sit beside her hear not words, but feel truth.

Her temples are paths. Her sermons are the long silences of walking. She is the **protector of the lost**, the broken, and those seeking to remake themselves. Redemption, to Ukuh, is not given — it is walked toward.

When a smith reforges shattered steel, when a thief seeks honest work, when a wanderer finds a village — **Ukuh smiles**.
