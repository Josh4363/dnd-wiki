Mort was once seen as a liberator of hidden truths. That was before his thirst ignited the Long Night. Though outlawed in some circles, many still whisper prayers to him when they risk burning for knowledge. His flame is both a torch and a funeral pyre.

He is seen as a wooded mystical figure constantly on fire. Every step he takes causes ashes of wooden skin to fall off only to seeming regenerate quickly.

He is worshipped by those who crave **freedom, fire, and forbidden truths.** His temples are scorched ruins or libraries too dangerous to open. His symbol, a tree on fire, is both warning and promise: _To know is to burn, but to burn is to see clearly._

Mort speaks through wild dreams and burning pages. He offers no comfort  only truth and the flames to reshape it.
