Sigr is the patron of triumph and prosperity, often worshipped in the frost-covered north. Her doctrine teaches that victory, like ice, preserves greatness. It is said her breath freezes doubt, and her favor grants conquest. Traders and tacticians often whisper her name before a deal or a duel.

Sigr wears victory like a crown — tall, proud, and cold as the snows of her homeland. Sigr is depicted as a regal woman clad in icy gilded armor. Her eyes are sapphires and her breath turns to frost. She rides a white elk into battle and carries a banner that never tears. Her skin is pale as moonlit ice, her breath like a northern gale. In her arms, she carries both the spear and the coin purse — for in her faith, **fortune favors the triumphant.**

She rewards not just might, but cunning — those who win, no matter the means. Nobles offer tributes for political victories; generals burn banners in her name before a campaign.

Worship of Sigr is common among the Kuzanites and the frost-born of the **Territories of Eternal Snow**, where survival _is_ victory. Her temples often double as treasuries and coliseums.
