Zyzzic is the roaring heartbeat of the common folk — the one who lifts boulders and burdens alike. His worship is less temple and more action: sweat, scars, and triumph over pain. He’s especially venerated by adventurers and those too proud to beg for divine aid.

A colossal figure of sinew and storm, Zyzzic is often depicted bare-chested, with a great beard and arms like tree trunks. Clad in simple cloth or bare-chested, with burns and scars. His laughter booms louder than thunder, and his tears fall only during drought.

He **blesses effort** — not outcome. His followers revere sweat, calluses, and bruises as marks of divine favor. Whether hauling stone, swinging an axe, or charging into battle, the laborer honors Zyzzic.

He’s often depicted holding a lightning bolt clenched in a bloody fist — a reminder that **power is earned, not given.**
