**_“Every fool is a prophet with the right dice.”_  

- **Domains**: Luck, Preformances
- **Symbol**: a coin being flipped
- **Patrons**: Gamblers, Travelers, Degenerates, Performers
- **Alias**: Fucking cocksucker answer my prayers

Jolk is the god of bad timing, lucky breaks, and stage curtains that fall too soon. Both adored and cursed, his worship is mostly informal: a flick of a coin, a muttered prayer before a dice roll, a smirk at the absurd. He answers prayers  but only if it’ll be funny.

Jolk appears in many forms a laughing beggar, a beautiful liar, a drunk on a stage. His coin never lands the same way twice. But the most common one depicts him of being some type of abomination that was mid shift. He **delights in uncertainty**, in chaos, in the theatre of life. 

Chaos is divine. Jolk teaches that luck is fickle and the world is a stage. He favors the daring, the foolish, and those who laugh at fate.

He answers when it’s funny. His symbol, a coin mid-flip, adorns cards, masks, and tattoos of rogues and wanderers. It is said when you see a beggar smile _just before a storm_, Jolk is nearby.
