There are much to the divine that even with all records gathered and studied, that we do not know as mere mortals. What we do know is of the Great Pantheon of this Continent, 10? Greater Deities who are widely worshipped publicly and privately. Each of these 10 are guaranteed to have some level or worship in any of the major cities or hubs.  While they may have varying levels of worship, each one has their unique domains and strong  influence over this world.

There is also the matter of Lesser Deities. These Primordials have worshippers in the hundreds if they are lucky. Certain areas of the continent will be more accepting than others in this taboo brand of worship. Often mistaking this worship to a more Patron-style relationship. Now speaking of Patrons, these are primordial as well, with rule over their own domains, but their aim is not to be worship and grant blessings. It is far more directly transactional. In exchange for great power they will ask for something of the mortal they are making a pact with. Something more specific and tangible than a few measly prayers and offerings. These Patrons domains are often smaller and weaker than Greater Deities or hell, even Lesser Deities, but their rewards of power are more direct to the receiver.

Then you also have the Primordials who just walk the land, go against their instincts of worship and followers and just leave. All this means is that these people have the potential for godhood, and even immortality. These are a rare bunch, and tough bastards, but they are, without worship, and weaker than the aforementioned groups above.

A quick summary on some of these terms:
- **Primordials**- Beings with potential for godhood, most likely came before us
- **Patrons**- Sometimes referred to as Demons, etc. Looking more for followers than believers, they are direct in their blessings, but often come for more than a price.
- **Lesser Deities**- These Deities have followers sometimes in the hundreds, bigger domains than patrons,  but more hyper focused than the Greater Deities and are more traditional in their approach
- **The Greater Deities**- These are the major Deities used to worship across the Continent. Worshippers in the thousands/millions. Have major domains, sometimes overlapping with each other. Often believed to be the strongest.
	- All Deities and Patrons are Primordials but not all primordial are Patrons and Deities
		- Next step up is Patrons who grant power
			- Next is Lesser Deities who can bless, boon, etc. for worship but usually have hyper specific domains
				- Greater Deities can do it all.
