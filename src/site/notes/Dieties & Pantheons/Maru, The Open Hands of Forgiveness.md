**_"There is strength in softness; it takes power to forgive."

- **Domains**: Grace, Growth, Light
- **Symbol**: Two hands outstretched with a sun in the background
- **Patrons**: Judges and Magistrates, Farmers, Carpenters
- **Alias**: Mother Grace, Nurturer, Parents, Limpura(Grower)

Often invoked during reconciliation and seasons of planting, Maru is the gentle twin flame to Makiâ€™s unbending justice. Her temples are peaceful gardens, and her clerics are mediators, healers, and caretakers. She teaches that forgiveness is a harvest long, but fruitful.

Where Maki strikes, Maru soothes. Draped in robes of woven gold and flax, Maru is depicted with kind, tired eyes and hands always outstretched. Her hands glow faintly golden, and she leaves blooming plants in her footsteps. Her voice is soft, slow, and patient like rain over tilled fields.

Worshippers call her **Mother Grace**, and see her as the wellspring of second chances. Her teachings speak to **growth through forgiveness, strength through nurturing**, and the grace to move forward unshackled by shame.

She is most revered after storms literal and personal. Farmers till the soil in her name, parents call on her to guide their children, and judges invoke her when clemency outweighs punishment.
