### Historical Figures

**St. Trystain** *The King Who Never Was/First Son of Zyzzic* - During Nuva Prima's early years 1st-e-444, it began a small encampment of settlers and traders. Only 12 knights accompanied them into the brave unknown. After the first year, only 1 remained, and that is St. Trystain. He was a devoted follower of Zyzzic and aimed to complete his mission and take care of this encampment until it is fully grown. He would help chop wood, farm, save villagers, and even had medical training to help those in need.  That said, he was most known for his courage and his giant war axe-==Verdict of Zyzzic==. With this he repelled the orc tribes from the north, bandits and pirates from the east, and wolf packs that roamed the area. Despite months of writing for aid, it never came. Then on 1st-E-447 St. Trystain found a towering monster. A Great-Boar, who has taken some of the villagers lives in the area descended on the growing settlement. He along with his axe rushed into action and dispatched the beast and his clan. Unfortunately, Trystain sustained unhealable injuries during the fight, but not before bringing the boar to the village for a feast. He passed after his first bite of boar. Within 2 days of his death, the reinforcements he requested finally arrived. Due to this he is a revered figure in Nuva Prima. 


**Ashtrol boy** -  A legendary figure who is prophesized to ascend to godhood and join the pantheon of 10 as it's final member.


**Emperor Kormandir**- *Ukuh's Champion/Land Lord* - Fought in [[Contents/Commonly Known History#^d33c2f\|The Mirillion War]]
{ #0db8b8}

He was a legendary ruler of the First Great Era, best known for his unwavering leadership during the **Drazagie War**. A strategic mind with divine conviction, he is credited with saving the city of Dancer and halting the Merfolk invasion that threatened all land-bound civilization in the [[Pyke Provinces/Kormandir's Plains\|Kormandir's Plains]].

Guided by a prophetic dream from the goddess [[Dieties & Pantheons/Ukuh, Earth Mother\|Ukuh, Earth Mother]], Kormandir personally unearthed the ancient materials **Adamantine** and **Spellant**, turning the tide of the war. Under his command, magic and steel were forged into perfect harmony, allowing mortals to defy the sea itself.

Kormandir is remembered as both a warrior-emperor and a visionary. His legacy lives on in the land that now bears his name, in the city whose walls still hold, and in the **Trident of the Drowned King**, which hangs above his former court.
