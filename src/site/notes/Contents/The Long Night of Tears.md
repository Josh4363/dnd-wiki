The _Long Night of Tears_ or sometimes just called *The Long Night* refers to the cataclysmic event that concluded the First Great Era [(F.G.E)](<[[Colloquialisms, Mannerisms, & Slang#^eb63a3\|F.G.E]]>), following the committing of the one known _Cardinal Sin_. The continent had just emerged from the brutal _Unification Wars_, having finally repelled the last bastions of Aggrerio's invasion. With victory achieved, the kingdoms turned inward, attempting to heal and rebuild after centuries of conflict.

No kingdom suffered more grievously than the Basilkus Kingdom, razed utterly to the ground. Its sole surviving heir, **Prince Amond**—then known as _The Dark Prince_—begged the other kingdoms to unite and launch a retaliatory invasion westward into Aggrerio. However, the four remaining great kingdoms refused, seeing this time as one for peace and reconstruction.

Amond’s pleas fell on deaf ears. As the years passed and his requests were ignored, whispers spread across the courts and taverns. He became known mockingly as **"The Prince of Beggars."**

Spurned, the prince withdrew to the ruins of his homeland, in what is now known as **modern-day [[Pyke Provinces/Bruitalis\|Bruitalis]]**. There, he gathered thirteen powerful mages—each having achieved the rank of archmage. He promised them lordship and eternal legacy if they could help him resurrect his fallen kingdom—its people, its soldiers, and his family—so he could lead them in conquest once more.

Eight mages abandoned the quest, sensing doom. But **five remained**, intrigued by the arcane challenge. Together, they dared to break one of the holiest taboos inscribed in every shrine of **[[Gholm, The Masked Man \| Gholm]]**, god of death and silence:

> _"To return one newly taken is a mercy.  
> But to steal one from Gholm's Domain—those who have ridden [[Dieties & Pantheons/Soeng Sing, The Sky Serpent\| The Sky Serpent]]—  
> is theft. And theft from the Dead is a sin against the Silence."_

Their plan? Entice and trap **Gholm** himself by misusing his sacred relic—the **Mask of Gholm**—and thereby access his domain directly. From there, they would recover the soul of Amond’s mother, the **High Queen**, and restore her to life.

They succeeded only partially. Using necromancy, they reformed her body in perfect condition—but her soul remained absent. In desperation, they used Gholm’s mask to search the vast afterlife. But death is not solely Gholm's domain. The souls of the dead pass into the **Carin**, an endless pit overseen by countless primordial forces across innumerable planes of reality.

From this uncharted place, the mages drew forth a soul—but not the Queen's.

The entity they summoned was foreign. Malicious. Ancient. Before they could react, the **Prince of Beggars** interfered, murdering one of the mages to halt their banishment ritual. He approached the reanimated body of his mother—only to realize something was wrong.

The mask had not only preserved her form but _enhanced_ it. Her eyes glowed like yellow lanterns. Her fingernails grew into claws. Bones cracked through flesh to form winged protrusions from her back. Her teeth sharpened into fangs—razors peeking from the corners of her smile.

In his blind grief, Amond had summoned the **first true vampire** this realm had ever known.

With Gholm now absent from his divine post—trapped, silenced—the creature grew in power. It twisted the remaining mages into **liches**, spread vampirism through the land, and with its newfound servants, cast a ritual spell that blacked out the sky.

The sun would not rise again for **167 years**.

### The First Years of Darkness
![Pasted image 20250707194809.png](/img/user/Pics/Pasted%20image%2020250707194809.png)
In the early decades of the _Long Night_, chaos reigned. Vampiric forces spread with terrifying precision, suggesting the vampire was no stranger to conquest in its former existence.

- **Kuzan** fell first, overwhelmed by sheer force.
    
- **Voyager** crumbled in the second year, when its King was turned by his favored consort and pledged his armies to the darkness.
    
- **Nuva Prima**'s council was assassinated within three years.
    

Only **Dancer** and the **Northern Territories** managed to hold firm, responding swiftly and with brutal resistance.

The continent descended into tyranny. Mortals were herded like cattle. Draconian laws were imposed. Certain races, whose blood proved too bitter for the vampires' taste—**most [[Contents/The World Around You#^3f1b3d \| Giantfolk]], Kobolds**, and **Changelings**—were elevated as enforcers and overseers of the new order. Other species became livestock, slaves and worse.

### The End of the Night

It wasn’t until the year **1st-E-1004** that the sun shone once more.

How the darkness was lifted remains unknown—some say a divine pact, others speak of a martyr or ancient artifact. What is certain is that the vampires, liches, and their armies faded into shadow, seemingly vanquished… for now.

But scars remain. Generations were born and died without ever seeing the sun. And to this day, tales of **"The Prince of Beggars"**, the **Lost Mages**, and the **First Vampire Queen** are told in hushed voices by firelight.
