Each kingdom and province has their own laws and customs but there are a few that oversee.


### **Core Tenets** (Recognized Across Most Kingdoms)

These laws are stable across borders, and considered **“unalienable”** by the Council of Realms.

1. **The Right to Life**: Murder, soul-binding, and unjust killing are capital offenses. Only lawful combat, [[Contents/Mak' Marrah\|Mak' Marrah]], or divine justice exempt.
    
2. **The Sanctity of the Mind**: Enchantment, charm, and domination magic used without consent is a high crime.
    
3. **The Balance of Power**: Necromancy, high level chronomancy, and planar manipulation are banned without state license or divine sanction.
    
4. **Honest Dealings**: Fraud, forgery, oathbreaking, or breach of magical contract is punishable by fine, labor, or magical debt binding.
    
5. **Freedom of Soul and Body**: Slavery is outlawed. However, indenture, magical debt-bondage, and knowledge-compulsion persist in morally gray zones (esp. under The Burning Lord’s influence).
    
6. **The Law Above Rank**: Nobles and clergy may not be exempt from prosecution under divine or mortal law. Enforcement varies.


## ⚖️ **Divine Addendas**

> _“Where mortal law ends, divine will begins.”_

Each deity influences regional legal philosophy. These clauses are often invoked by magistrates, clergy, or cultural leaders when interpreting or justifying law.
