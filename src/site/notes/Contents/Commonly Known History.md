#### Zero Era
The Era before the first, before recorded and written history. Not much is known about the earlier years of this era, only that it was a more savage time where dragons, and giants dominated the land and the mortals on it. Since then dragons became more sparse and recluse, where giants are still threats, retreated to more desolate places.

Waynodes, ways of teleportation came in during the ending period of this, write around where scholars began actively sharing and recording what is happening in the world. Before this, magic was only accessible to those born to it and nobles, spell books, scrolls and other written arcana were taboo and forbidden. There was also a time where the mortal population faced extinction towards the end but recordings about this were extremely limited.

Other than these few notable anecdotes, extremely little is known about the era.
#### Era of Bloodshed
Also known as **The Era of Bloodshed**, the First Great Era spanned nearly a millennium marked by ceaseless war, fractured alliances, and political treachery across the continent. It was a time when **power changed hands more often than the seasons**, and the sword held more sway than the crown.

**Travel was perilous.** Not only did armies clash across roads and borders, but the wilderness teemed with deserters, raiders, and monstrous creatures drawn to the chaos. Cities became fortresses; villages were often burned before dawn.

Suspicion ruled the age. Accusations of **treason, heresy, and espionage** could befall anyone, noble or common. Dungeons overflowed with the accused, and assassinations were not a scandal they were policy.

The era began with the iron-fisted rule of **King Mordac the Tyrant**, whose cruelty sparked the **Mak' Marrah** that would end his reign in blood and flame.

The Era of Bloodshed came to its close with the final tolling of **[[Contents/The Long Night of Tears\|The Long Night]]**, a cataclysmic event that reshaped not only the map, but the very soul of the world.
#### The War for The Mirillion 1st-E-202-203
{ #d33c2f}


Drazagie, the drowned king and leader of a massive Merfolk army, threatened the city of Dancer and the rest of the [[Pyke Provinces/Kormandir's Plains\|Kormandir's Plains]]. He demanded fealty and tribute from every land walker there, as well as 100 slaves a month to be sent to drown, Emperor Kormandir did not let this slide and so the war was declared.

The Merfolk attacked strong and quick, sinking naval and supply ships with no real challenge. The Merfolk are stronger, and faster the average mortal, even on land. "as smarrt as an elf, as resourceful as a human, as strong as an orc, as sturdy as a dwarf, and as big as a goliath." They even started setting up camps in spots of land, they were winning so hard. Emperor Kormandir sent out small battalions to engage and repel, but only the necessary numbers to keep citizens safe, and slow their march towards the City. The City itself took an onslaught of damage from the sea side, but was soon repelled by throwing barrels of oil of the walls and into the Bay of Mirillion then lighting them on fire. 

Emperor Kormandir was then given a dream by the god [[Dieties & Pantheons/Ukuh, Earth Mother\|Ukuh, Earth Mother]] that the answer he sought for against the sea, was berried beneath him. So he and his royal guard dug for months on hand. The Merfolk were quickly surrounding the City of Dancer about to start a seige from both sea and land. Kormandir found his game-changer, 2 substances located in rock beneath the city of Dancer; Adamantine and Spellant. 

A merfolk skin was tough, and sturdy, so much so that iron and steel only had half the effect they normally do. Adamantine is the single strongest material known to mortal-kind, Kormandir quickly built, swords spears, arrows and more to give them the advantage they needed against merfolk.

Spellant on the other hand was a chalky substance that helps absorb spells when cast. This harnessing of spells allowed the armies Dancer to attack with spells even under water. Battlemages from all over appeared before Kormandir to test this substance and use it against the Merfolk in  the sea. 

In a mere 2 months from the discovery of these 2 substances, the Merfolk were repelled and surrendered. Also, the Trident of The Drowned King Drazagie hangs over the court of Dancer. The plains were then named after their Emperor who won them the war.
