A sacred act that is older than recorded history itself, but one that all customs hold dear. Mak' Marrah, the word holds the same meaning in every tongue. When an occurrence such as this happens, it is surely providence from the gods, which is why it is still recognized legally in the Continent.

When a dispute is brought to the forefront, and all measures have been taken a Mak' Gorah can be then called. The Mak' Marrah is an ancient duel to the death between 2 parties that sort out the dispute permanently. Winner take all, is correct, and holds legal authority. Whereas the loser, is disproven and worst, loses their lives. 

## The 10 Tenants of Mak'Marrah
1. Civil discussion must take place before the call.
2. Only to be done if both sides consent, or a fortnight goes by without resolution then 1 side may invoke.
3. Once a Mak' Marrah is invoked then both sides sign over their lives to the outcome of the duel.
4. Local government, or the owner of the land where it is to take place, must reside as an arbitrary party to over see. The Arbiter decides when and where and how big the arena shall be. The Arbiter must be compensated with an amount that they find worthy from both parties.
5. One side may back out of the Mak' Marrah as long as the event has not begun yet but will lose the dispute entirely.
6. Any spells or hexes cannot be cast before Mak'Marrah begins. To break this, loses your claim. From this point on, it is you and the other person, no outside help.
7. The Fighters start at 3 paces away from each other (15ft) and must remain in the arena the Arbiter decides or forfeit their claim.
8. Once the Mak'Marrah begins it must come to an end, no running. Should one refuse to take the life of another, it is on the Arbiter to take the life for the victor. 2 combatant shall fight and 1 shall remain, declared the victor.
9. Once the Mak' Marrah is settled, the matter is settled as well. No revenge will be taking place, no headhunting, to disobey this tenant is to invoke the wrath of gods and throw society into chaos. 
10. The victor may take one item from the fallen, otherwise all will be returned to the loser's party or berried with them. If the Mak'Marrah was invoked over a possession, it will be handed over and count as the looted item.

Despite some beliefs, magic is widely permitted in a Mak' Marrah though in some cases, court mandated battlemages are held on standby to limit and escape spells a contestant might use to flee.
