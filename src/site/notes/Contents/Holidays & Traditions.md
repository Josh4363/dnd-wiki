## Holidays

#### St. Trystain's Hunt

A Royal hunt that takes place in Nuva Prima. Takes place once a year in the Western Woods, one the spring solstice. The Kingdom and any surrounding villages are invited into the hunt where for 1 day all sanctions are lifted with hunting boar, deer, and other game. The markets and taverns often mark down their prices and are given incentives from the local government to do so. A play is held re-enacting St. Trystain's life and story. Finally, after the city-wide feasts have been held, participants can put forth the game they have caught to be weighed and measured, whoever produces the largest of each type is granted prizes by the Kingdom.

#### Sun Blessing Festival

Held at the beginning of summer Priests, Priestess', and clergy will hear the sins of the common folk, be given a task and penance to do for that day. They must finish the penance before sun down and be granted forgiveness, if there is failure to do so the sins are not forgiven.
