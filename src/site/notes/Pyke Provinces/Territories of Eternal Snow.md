Cold, rigid and unforgiving. The Territories of Eternal Snow will punish those who do not pay it the respect it deserves. It is not named this for no reason, in recorded history there has never been a day where snow has not fallen from the sky. In the Fourth Great Age, there's been a total of 200 days on record where the sun has shone, which sounds good out loud but considering the F.G.A has lasted 867 years it is quite something.

If the cold does not get you, the local wildlife will. Locals will tell plenty of stories of werewolves, werebears, or were-whatever's eating their cattle at night, that is, unless the locals don't get you themselves. Some of the locals don't take to kindly to outsiders wandering around these parts. That said, some tribes and the Major strongholds of Polaris and Stullgen are open to trading with outsiders.
