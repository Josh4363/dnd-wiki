Fit for those with the strength to take what they need. Kormandir's Plains, named after [[Contents/Notable NPCâ€™s#^0db8b8\|Emperor Kormandir]] who repelled the Merfolk Army and saved the continent, this land is still very fertile and bountiful. Sprawling savannah, a dense jungle, and of course a great plain stretches from end to the other, there are quite a lot of diverse wildlife to be seen here.


This is also the only province where it is also a Kingdom. All of the plains are united under one banner that sits in the city of Dancer. The seat of the Emperor is there and it is through his name, that they are entering a rather prosperous era, even more so than the others. Trading with other kingdoms, on this continent and others are going quite well. Large reserves of wheat, pelt, furs, sugars, livestock, and Spellant are harvested and sold here, making Dancer quite a luxurious city. That said their greatest export and weapon are their deposits of adamantine, a rare metal that is said to slice through magic with ease, and through iron like parchment.

Dancer and the Plains look like a great place to live, that said there is still talk of the odd Merchant ship drowning at the edges of Mirillion Bay, probably a few salty Merfolk still mad at Emperor Kormandir.
