Originally named the "Dead man's Desert" after [[Contents/The Deadman's Game\|event]] swept the continent, it was quickly renamed. The Jewel Desert has plenty of wild beasts and giant insects roaming its ever-shifting sands. News of Giant Scorpions roaming the Jewel is often told. Outside of a few sparsely placed Oasis' from the middle it would be around a week's journey either way to a body of water.

That said, one would be remiss in mentioning the Jewel without following up by talking about the Kingdom of Kuzan. The Kingdom city is home to the great Glacier and reports to keep the kingdom just as cold as the [[Pyke Provinces/Territories of Eternal Snow\|Territories of Eternal Snow]] while having the desert sun blaring down at it. It is lost to time as to how the Glacier got there, but if you ever would want to get Frostbite while dying sun burn, this is the perfect 1-2 combo for you.

Outside of Kuzan, you will find many smaller tribes who know how to maneuver the desert much better than I ever will. These tribes are often referred to as "Sol-Tekee" and live in a few holds scattered around the Desert. They comprise of mostly Bugbear, Goblins, Goliaths, Human, Orcs, and Tabaxi traders who descend from those traders who started [[Contents/The Deadman's Game\|The Deadman's Game]] all those years ago. Of course some outsiders marry and find their way into these tribes, but still this is what they are mostly comprised of. That said for the most part the Sol Tekee are friendly folk more than willing to charm you out of your coin and do it with a smile on their faces.

Do not forget though, for every Sol Tekee, friend wandering the desert, there are at least 10 bandits willing to take your money in a more direct manner.
