This area has gone through a lot of names throughout the years. "Dorshambolt," "Porcus Basilkus", but in this day and age, it is commonly referred to as [[Pyke Provinces/Bruitalis\|Bruitalis]]. This was once a colony, or hub much like any other, small but plenty of resources to be set out. Then a cardinal sin was committed, which lead to the [[Contents/The Long Night of Tears\|The Long Night of Tears]] which marked the end of the 1st-E-1004.

Since then the wildlife of deer, birds, and owlbears all quickly left the area, and in their place monsters of unknown origin quickly settled in. Fort Triton, a dispatch from all the kingdoms of this continent, is set there to keep an eye on things. Luckily the creatures within do not seem interested in spreading outwards and are content in sitting in the monstrous pit they find themselves in.

Nowadays [[Contents/The Kingdoms\|The Kingdoms]] have a different use for Bruitalis. It has become a mega-prison to send the worst of the worst criminals to. They of course can be put to death or learn their lessons in the wilderness. And for some of you who question if magic can teleport them out, for some reason displacement spells (Misty Step/Dimension door/etc.) do not work here. Then there will be some of you who will state that swimming is a valid option, the reason no Port was ever built was due to the immense amount of Leviathans, swimming in the surrounding seas, so if swimming was your main option of escape good luck. It is even said that the Kraken has made it's den just a few nautical miles off the shore.

Escape is not unheard of though, the odd bandit will find themselves lucky to avoid being torn to shreds or being spotted by the guards at Fort Triton and will soon make the trek to hide out somewhere. Most likely in the [[Pyke Provinces/Badland Provinces\|Badland Provinces]].
