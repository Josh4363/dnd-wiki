The largest out of all the provinces, as the name suggests it takes up most of the western half of the continent. But, contrary to the name the area is not just a big forest-like biome. 

While it does have a lot of trees and arborous areas, places like the the Land of Ample Water offers an amazing and unique experience. Whether it's the creatures, the magic in the land, for reasons unbeknownst to the general public, the lands offer an area where aquatic creatures flow freely and swim to and from the sea and sky. A truly beautiful and, depending who is swimming around, dangerous experience. 

Next, towards the south, there is a less beautiful but just as dangerous area like The Bog. Swamps are located all over the continent,  but the Bog is the largest uninterrupted piece of swampland on the Continent. Full of gators and other swamp monsters, the area is constantly left in the shade. Watch your back, because someone definitely is.

There are also an abundance of lakes located across the province, the biggest being The Lake of Heroes. This lake is said to be where High King Triton took his last drink before passing away. Whether in the woods, the trees or in the water, there are plenty of creatures to hunt, fish, or get eaten by!
