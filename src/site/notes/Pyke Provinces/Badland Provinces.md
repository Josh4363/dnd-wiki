Ah yes, imagine you make it out of [[Pyke Provinces/Bruitalis\|Bruitalis]] alive just to live the rest of your life out here. The [[Pyke Provinces/Badland Provinces\|Badland Provinces]] are just that bad. Every other province has their difficulties but has some level of redeemability. [[Pyke Provinces/The Jewel Desert\|The Jewel Desert]] is harsh but plenty of good trading partners, [[Pyke Provinces/Territories of Eternal Snow\|Territories of Eternal Snow]] is frigid but if you are strong enough plenty of land, [[Pyke Provinces/Bruitalis\|Bruitalis]] you don't have to live there. But the Bad lands is just a barren wasteland with a bunch of mountains. Sure you run into the odd pirate vessel in the bay of bandits but then what? They probably just shoot you here.

The Badlands are just where convicts from all over hide out because they know the guards would never search for them out there. Lands are too barren to grow anything, just a bunch of rocks and mountains. Forget about harvesting the goats who live there, eat enough of them and apparently a massive Goat will come find you and whoop your ass. The only option is to fish in the Bay, where the aforementioned bandits or Pirates come in and rob you blind. And this is all before these psychopath bounty hunters start tracking you for some gold. Oh right something else I forgot lol Dragons.

Make smart choices kids, if you're a wanted man leave the continent, or better you behave and be a law-abiding citizen
