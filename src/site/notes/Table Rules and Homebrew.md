## Character creation
Make a character have fun!
[Character races ](https://www.dndbeyond.com/species?srsltid=AfmBOorYtYfH9UIes2rnMo8Ut_ReqNB1iFuDXmtF8a-WIdje8w91egI6)(try to stick to the PHB ones, but if any other ones interest you ask DM first.)
[Character classes](https://5e.tools/classes.html#artificer_tce)
Don't be afraid to ask if you need help making a character, this shit is like crack to me.

# Manners & Table Etiquette
1. **Be kind**
   Straightforward just be a decent human being
2. **Don't be afraid to ask questions**
   I don't bite, I might make jokes but I never mean them
3. **Don't be afraid to tell the DM privately/I aint no snitch**
   Any issues with anything about the game, anything offensive, misunderstood rulings, not having fun, do not be afraid to msg me!
4. **Be a supporting actor**
   EVERYONE will get their time to shine in regards to fighting/RP/etc. be a fan of your team mates successes as much as they are with yours. 
5. **Missed Sessions LMK**
   If  you are unable to make a session please let me know ASAP so I prepare accordingly, I put a lot of prep into these. I also understand that life happens, but do your best.
6. **Pay Attention pls**
   It's a long game, I get it and we are most likely playing online and it is easy to browse other things, but please at the very least try to be quiet and do not distract other players
7. **DM Privileges**
   I get the final say on rulings and what happens, I will do my best to accommodate and hear out any issues with rulings but for the sake of moving the game at a reasonable pace, my word is the final say.


# Homebrew & Table specific rulings


## Battle Sense

My homebrewed name for game mechanic where someone can roll for and see if they can make out any features or secret mechanics an enemy or person has in battle. Yes other DM's have thought of this, and I stole it unapologetically, I just like calling it this instead.

## Inspiration

Inspirations are free re-rolls the DM can choose to grant players for any reason they are truly impressed. Think of a clever way to overcome a trap or an enemy. Boom Inspiration. Sing a song whether beautifully or horribly. Inspiration. Do something specifically stupid inspiration. Pay attention to the plot and genuinely surprise me with a lore drop. Inspiration. Basically if you impress me in any way you get inspiration.

## Mama Birding

You can use your potion to heal an ally but you have to mamabird into their mouths canonically.


# The Baldur's Gate 3 Situation

I get it, you only started playing D&D because of Baldur's Gate. There are some differences with mechanics in the game compared to here.
