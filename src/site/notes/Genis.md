### **Overview:**  
Once a cattle farm during the final years of the **Long Night**, **Genis** has since been reclaimed and transformed into a promising lakeside settlement under the banners of **[[Contents/The Kingdoms#^3c6f8d\|Nuva Prima]]**. At the dawn of the **S.G.E.**, it was designated as a sanctuary for victims of the Long Night regime, and has steadily grown in both prosperity and reputation.

### **Economy & Culture:**  
Genis thrives on its **abundant freshwater fish** due to being right beside the Lake of Heores and the uniquely flavorful **Dinkle Berries** that grow wild around the village. These two staples form the foundation of both the local economy and its budding reputation as a **rustic getaway for nobles** seeking quiet luxury and excellent wine.

### **Challenges:**  
Despite its wealth and popularity with visitors, **permanent settlement remains low**. The small population struggles to keep up with rising demands for infrastructure, protection, and expansion.

### **Adventurers Guild Presence:**  
To support the growing village and maintain safety, the **Adventurers Guild** has initiated a program assigning low-ranking members to settlements like Genis. Though optional, participation offers **increased pay and recognition** within the guild, making Genis a popular destination for ambitious adventurers.

### **Development Initiatives:**  
Nuva Primaâ€™s government and various guilds are testing new incentives to encourage permanent migration to Genis. With its scenic beauty, high-value exports, and increasing adventurer presence, the village is becoming an **attractive prospect for settlers, merchants, and entrepreneurs alike**.
